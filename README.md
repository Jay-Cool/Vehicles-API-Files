# Vehicles-API-Files

This repository contains the scripts from the ServiceNow Scripted REST API series on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhqGp3sUzhvrPxGcTawhMl6v49ACCTlG

The files include:
1) v1 - The initial version of the API, using GlideRecord.
2) v2 - Only Get Vehicles.js was updated to permit encoded queries for the vehicle model.
3) v3 - All scripts updated to use GlideRecordSecure. 
4) Some sample request and response bodies for creating and updating records.

These are simple scripts and intended for learning purposes only. They are NOT intended for production use!
